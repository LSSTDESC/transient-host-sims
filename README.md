# Transient-Host Galaxy Simulations
This repository contains the code and data used for simulating transients and their host galaxies for PLAsTiCC version 2. Our pipeline uses the code SNANA (Kessler+2009) for simulating transients, and is described in detail in Lokken and Gagliano, 2022 (in prep).

Please contact Martine Lokken (lokken@astro.utoronto.ca) and Alex Gagliano (gaglian2@illinois.edu) with any questions/comments.
